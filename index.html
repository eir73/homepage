                                        Learned about <b>Tour de France</b> and decided to hold my very own <b>Tour de <i>Trump</i></b>. Is America not great enough for that cycling competition?
                                        Ran a second hand airline called <b>Trump Shuttle.</b> What a waste of money, I had to sell it, now it is <b>American Airlines Shuttle</b>, btw &#128521;

                                    <p>I bought the <b>Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach</b> and turned it into a private club. You can join if you pay <b>$200K</b> initiation fee (and there is another annual fee for members, it is very expensive to be rich). That year I also opened a casino called <b>Trump Castle</b>. My wife Ivana became a manager, because she is another Trump!</p>

All this to make architectural critic Paul Goldberger say in 1983 that the tower's atrium is <i>"the most pleasant interior public space to be completed in New York in some years"</i>. At the same time I also started a repair job on the Wollman Rink in Central Park and completed the work in three months for <b>$1.95 million</b>, which was $775,000 less than the initial budget!</p>
